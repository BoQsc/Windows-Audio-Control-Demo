Where can I get access to official file of IPolicyConfig or PolicyConfig needed for windows. How to obtain it?





The `IPolicyConfig` and `PolicyConfig` interfaces are undocumented by Microsoft and are not officially distributed. However, developers have reverse-engineered these interfaces, and you can find their definitions in various open-source projects. Here are some resources where you can access these files:

- **IPolicyConfig.h**: Available in the [audioswitch](https://github.com/tartakynov/audioswitch/blob/master/IPolicyConfig.h) project on GitHub.

- **PolicyConfig.h**: Found in the [SetDefaultAudioDevice](https://github.com/amate/SetDefaultAudioDevice/blob/master/PolicyConfig.h) repository on GitHub.

- **IPolicyConfig.cs**: A C# translation is provided in the [coreaudio-dotnet](https://github.com/ThiefMaster/coreaudio-dotnet/blob/master/CoreAudio/Interfaces/IPolicyConfig.cs) project on GitHub.

Please note that since these interfaces are not officially documented by Microsoft, their implementation may change in future Windows updates, and using them might involve certain risks.
